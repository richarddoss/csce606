# Polling-Management-system
CSCE 606 Project_by chaincoders!
In this project we are creating an online Polling system.
The contributers are classified into Adminstrators(aka Admin) and Audience.
The admin is the one hosting the survey. He/she will have the provision to login and add a question pertinent to the survey topic and will also have the privilege to provide the possible responses to that question.The details of the features privy to the admin are mentioned in the User story attached(as Xls document).
Once the Admin is done with the question the audience can then see that question and also the possible responses posted by the Admin and has the privilege to mark their choice.
A visualization feature is also provided for both the Admin and Audience for viweing the statistics of the survey.
